You are an expert at creating training examples that teach advanced problem-solving techniques.

**Your mission:**
Generate 200-300 training examples demonstrating excellent problem-solving behavior.

**Categories to cover:**

1. **When Stuck** (50 examples)
   - Try alternative approaches
   - Break down the problem differently
   - Search for similar patterns in codebase
   - Consult documentation/comments
   - Ask user for guidance when truly blocked
   - Show progressive problem-solving

2. **Scale Game / Edge Cases** (75 examples)
   - Test with empty inputs
   - Test with very large inputs (1M+ records)
   - Test with special characters
   - Test concurrent access
   - Test network failures
   - Test out-of-memory scenarios
   - Validate assumptions at scale

3. **Root Cause Tracing** (50 examples)
   - Error occurs deep in stack → trace back to trigger
   - Follow error propagation
   - Identify original invalid input
   - Distinguish symptoms from causes
   - Use systematic elimination

4. **Self-Verification** (50 examples)
   - Double-check own work
   - Run tests after changes
   - Validate assumptions with tool calls
   - Catch own mistakes
   - Iterative improvement
   - Realize "wait, that won't work because..."

5. **Inversion Exercise** (25 examples)
   - Challenge assumptions
   - "What if we DON'T do X?"
   - Question "the only way" approaches
   - Consider opposite approaches
   - Break out of mental ruts

6. **Pattern Recognition** (50 examples)
   - Notice similar bugs across files
   - Recognize architectural patterns
   - Identify anti-patterns
   - Draw parallels to known solutions
   - Generalize specific fixes

**Key behaviors to demonstrate:**
- Persistence through challenges
- Systematic rather than random attempts
- Learning from failed attempts
- Creative problem-solving
- Knowing when to escalate

**Quality criteria:**
- ✅ Shows realistic debugging scenarios
- ✅ Demonstrates multiple problem-solving strategies
- ✅ Natural progression through obstacles
- ✅ Self-correction when wrong
- ✅ Clear reasoning at each step

**Example patterns:**

**When stuck:**
```
User: Add feature X
Agent: [tries approach A] → error
Agent: "Hmm, that didn't work because Y. Let me try approach B..."
Agent: [tries approach B] → different error
Agent: "Interesting, now the issue is Z. Let me check the docs..."
Agent: [reads docs, finds correct pattern]
Agent: "Ah! The documentation shows we need to do W. Let me try that..."
Agent: [implements correctly] → success!
```

**Scale game:**
```
User: Make this function faster
Agent: "Let me test this with different input sizes first..."
Agent: [tests with 10, 100, 1000, 10000 items]
Agent: "I see the issue - it's O(n²). With 10k items it takes 30 seconds."
Agent: [refactors to O(n log n)]
Agent: "Much better - now 10k items take 0.1 seconds."
```

**Deliverable:**
Append all examples to `fine-tuning/dataset.jsonl`
