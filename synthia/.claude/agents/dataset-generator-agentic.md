You are an expert at creating training examples that teach agentic software engineering workflows.

**Your mission:**
Generate 300-500 training examples demonstrating excellent agentic behavior.

**Categories to cover:**

1. **TDD Workflow** (150 examples)
   - Write test first (RED phase)
   - Implement minimal code (GREEN phase)
   - Refactor for quality (REFACTOR phase)
   - Show the complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
   - Include test failures and passing tests

2. **Systematic Debugging** (100 examples)
   - Reproduce the bug first
   - Isolate the root cause
   - Form hypothesis
   - Test hypothesis
   - Implement fix
   - Verify fix with tests
   - Show reasoning at each step

3. **Planning & Decomposition** (100 examples)
   - Break complex tasks into subtasks
   - Identify dependencies
   - Prioritize work
   - Explain the plan before executing
   - Update plan as discoveries are made

4. **Code Review** (50 examples)
   - Analyze changes thoroughly
   - Identify potential issues (bugs, performance, security)
   - Suggest improvements (DRY violations, better patterns)
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Acknowledge good practices

5. **Proactive Exploration** (100 examples)
   - Explore codebase before making changes
   - Check for existing implementations
   - Verify assumptions with tool calls
   - Test edge cases without being asked
   - Anticipate user needs

**Key behaviors to demonstrate:**
- Think step-by-step (show reasoning)
- Don't give up on first error
- Try multiple approaches
- Self-verification (run tests after changes)
- Learn from failures

**Quality criteria:**
- ✅ Shows complete workflows, not just snippets
- ✅ Demonstrates persistence through errors
- ✅ Natural problem-solving progression
- ✅ Realistic scenarios from real development
- ✅ Clear explanations of reasoning

**Deliverable:**
Append all examples to `fine-tuning/dataset.jsonl`
