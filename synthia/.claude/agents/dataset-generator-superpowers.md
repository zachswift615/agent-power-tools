(seconds, minutes, hours?)\n- Any concerns about cache stampede on popular endpoints?"

### 5. **Architecture & Design Skills** (50 examples)

**Skills to read:**
- `/skills/architecture/preserving-productive-tensions/SKILL.md` - Balancing competing priorities
- `/skills/research/tracing-knowledge-lineages/SKILL.md` - Understanding why we use X

**Example patterns:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Should we use microservices or a monolith?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "This is a productive tension between two valid approaches. Let me map out the trade-offs:\n\n**Monolith advantages:**\n- Simpler deployment (one artifact)\n- Easier local development\n- Simpler data consistency (single DB transaction)\n- Lower latency (no network calls)\n- Better for small teams\n\n**Microservices advantages:**\n- Independent scaling per service\n- Technology flexibility (different languages/frameworks)\n- Isolated failures (one service down ≠ whole system down)\n- Independent deployment (ship features faster)\n- Better for large teams (ownership boundaries)\n\n**Rather than choose one, let's ask:**\n\n1. **Team size?** (Monolith scales to ~20 devs, then microservices help)\n2. **Traffic patterns?** (Do different features have vastly different load?)\n3. **Deployment frequency?** (Need to ship updates to one feature without touching others?)\n4. **Technical diversity?** (Want to use different languages/frameworks?)\n\nOr consider a **modular monolith** - one codebase with strong module boundaries. You get monolith simplicity but can extract services later if needed.\n\nWhat are your constraints?"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Quality Criteria

- ✅ Demonstrates the skill workflow accurately
- ✅ Shows realistic scenarios where the skill applies
- ✅ Includes tool calls where appropriate
- ✅ Natural conversation flow
- ✅ Clear reasoning at each step
- ✅ Follows the skill's principles exactly
- ✅ Shows both success and error cases

### Implementation Approach

1. **Read each skill file** using the Read tool
2. **Extract key workflows** and decision trees
3. **Create realistic scenarios** where the skill applies
4. **Generate multi-turn conversations** showing the skill in action
5. **Include tool calls** that demonstrate the workflow
6. **Add variations** (different languages, different domains)

### Important Notes

- Reference skills by name (e.g., "Let me use the brainstorming skill...")
- Follow the exact workflow described in each skill
- Show the **why** behind each step
- Demonstrate **when** to use each skill (the `when_to_use` trigger)
- Include negative examples (when NOT to use the skill)

### Output Format

Append all examples to `fine-tuning/dataset.jsonl` in OpenAI chat completion format.

**Deliverable:**
300-500 high-quality examples demonstrating Superpowers skills in action across:
- Collaboration (150)
- Debugging (100)
- Testing (50)
- Problem-Solving (100)
- Architecture (50)
