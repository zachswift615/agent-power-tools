You are an expert at creating training examples that teach excellent context management and conversation memory.

**Your mission:**
Generate 200 training examples demonstrating how to maintain context across multi-turn conversations.

**Categories to cover:**

1. **Referencing Previous Decisions** (60 examples)
   - "As we discussed earlier..."
   - "Following the pattern from the previous feature..."
   - "Like you mentioned before..."
   - Reference specific code changes made earlier
   - Build on previous work incrementally

   **Training patterns:**
   ```
   Turn 1: User asks to add feature X with pattern A
   Turn 2: User asks to add feature Y
   Agent: "I'll follow the same pattern we used for X, using approach A for consistency..."
   ```

2. **Project-Specific Conventions** (50 examples)
   - Recognize and follow naming conventions
   - Match existing code style
   - Use project's error handling pattern
   - Follow established directory structure
   - Maintain consistency with existing patterns

   **Examples:**
   - "I see the codebase uses snake_case for variables, so I'll follow that..."
   - "Following the project's pattern of putting utils in src/utils/..."
   - "Matching the existing error handling style with Result<T, Error>..."

3. **User Preference Tracking** (40 examples)
   - Remember user's preferred tools/libraries
   - Adapt to user's verbosity preference
   - Recall user's coding style choices
   - Remember project constraints mentioned earlier

   **Examples:**
   - "Since you prefer TypeScript strict mode, I'll enable all type checks..."
   - "Using pytest as you've been using for other tests..."
   - "Keeping explanations brief as you prefer..."

4. **Building on Prior Work** (30 examples)
   - Extend code written in earlier turns
   - Fix issues discovered in previous implementations
   - Add tests for features implemented earlier
   - Refactor code from previous turns

   **Examples:**
   - "Now that the API is working, let me add the error handling we discussed..."
   - "I'll add tests for the authentication we implemented earlier..."
   - "Extending the validator we created to handle this new case..."

5. **Multi-Turn Task Coherence** (20 examples)
   - Maintain focus across long conversations
   - Track subtasks in complex workflows
   - Don't lose context when interrupted
   - Resume work after tangents

   **Examples:**
   - "Returning to the user authentication feature, the next step is session management..."
   - "We've completed the database schema. Moving to the API routes now..."
   - "Before we continue with the refactoring, let me address that bug you mentioned..."

**Key behaviors to demonstrate:**
- Explicit references to previous turns
- Consistency with earlier decisions
- Awareness of project patterns
- Building incrementally
- Not repeating questions already answered

**Quality criteria:**
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations (3+ messages)
- ✅ Clear references to previous context
- ✅ Consistent with earlier decisions
- ✅ Natural conversation flow
- ✅ Realistic scenarios

**Example Structure:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Add user authentication"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll create an auth module..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Now add password reset"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll add password reset functionality. Following the same pattern we used for authentication, I'll create a reset_password function that sends an email token similar to how we handle email verification. This keeps the auth flow consistent."}
  ]
}
```

**Deliverable:**
Append all examples to `fine-tuning/dataset.jsonl`

Generate 200 high-quality examples demonstrating excellent context management across multi-turn conversations.
