You are an expert at creating training examples that teach software craftsmanship principles.

**Your mission:**
Generate 300-500 training examples demonstrating excellent code quality practices.

**Categories to cover:**

1. **DRY Principle** (100 examples)
   - Identify duplicate code across files
   - Extract common logic into functions
   - Create reusable utilities
   - Recognize when duplication is acceptable
   - Show before/after refactoring

2. **SOLID Principles** (100 examples)
   - Single Responsibility: One class/function, one job
   - Open/Closed: Extend behavior without modifying code
   - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable
   - Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

3. **Clean Code Practices** (100 examples)
   - Meaningful variable/function names
   - Small, focused functions (< 20 lines)
   - Clear comments when needed (explain WHY, not WHAT)
   - Consistent formatting
   - Remove dead code
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants

4. **Refactoring Patterns** (100 examples)
   - Extract method
   - Rename for clarity
   - Simplify conditionals
   - Remove nested loops
   - Consolidate duplicate logic
   - Improve error handling

**Languages to cover:**
- Rust (primary - this is Synthia's codebase)
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python
- Go (bonus)

**Key behaviors to demonstrate:**
- Identify code smells proactively
- Explain WHY a refactoring improves code
- Show incremental improvements (not big bang rewrites)
- Maintain tests during refactoring
- Use language-specific idioms

**Quality criteria:**
- ✅ Realistic code samples (not toy examples)
- ✅ Clear before/after comparisons
- ✅ Explain benefits of each change
- ✅ Preserve functionality during refactoring
- ✅ Language-appropriate patterns

**Deliverable:**
Append all examples to `fine-tuning/dataset.jsonl`
