# P1 Test Results - Issues Found

## Test Date
2025-10-18

## Build Tested
- Binary: `./synthia/target/release/synthia`
- Commits: `536751a` (word wrap), `152bce1` (JSON parser), `cf89eb6` (event batching)

---

## ‚úÖ What Works

### Word Wrapping
- **NO mid-word breaks observed** in the test
- Words like "templates" stay intact (not broken as "tem plates")
- Text wraps at word boundaries correctly

### Tool Execution
- Bash tools execute successfully
- Flask app created without issues
- Multiple tool calls work (pip install, python app.py, etc.)

### Event Batching
- Input handling works
- No crashes or hangs observed

---

## ‚ùå Issues Found

### Issue #1: Tool Output Alignment Problem

**Screenshot:** Image #1

**Description:**
Tool output (stdout/stderr) appears **offset/misaligned** from the left margin.

**Example from screenshot:**
```
[Tool: bash] ‚úì 426ms
                Command: python /Users/zachswift/projects/test-project-synthia/app.py

Output: stdout:
                * Serving Flask app 'app'
                                        * Debug mode: on

                stderr:
                        ...
```

**Expected behavior:**
```
[Tool: bash] ‚úì 426ms
Command: python /Users/zachswift/projects/test-project-synthia/app.py

Output: stdout:
  * Serving Flask app 'app'
  * Debug mode: on

stderr:
  ...
```

**Root cause (hypothesis):**
The tool output formatting in `ui/app.rs` is likely adding extra indentation or the "Command:" label is causing alignment issues.

**Location to investigate:**
- `synthia/src/ui/app.rs` - `UIUpdate::ToolResult` handler
- Look for how we print `Command:` and `Output:` labels

**Severity:** Minor (cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality)

### Issue #2: Input Line Duplication on Typing

**Screenshot:** Image #2

**Description:**
While typing the prompt, **the input line repeated itself multiple times** (appears ~20 times in green).

**Example from screenshot:**
```
You: Create a Flask TODO app with HTML templates and explain the code. Please create the app in
You: Create a Flask TODO app with HTML templates and explain the code. Please create the app in
You: Create a Flask TODO app with HTML templates and explain the code. Please create the app in
You: Create a Flask TODO app with HTML templates and explain the code. Please create the app in
[repeated ~20 times]
this directory: /Users/zachswift/projects/test-project-synthia
```

**Expected behavior:**
```
You: Create a Flask TODO app with HTML templates and explain the code. Please create the app in this directory: /Users/zachswift/projects/test-project-synthia
```

**Root cause (hypothesis):**
This is likely related to the **input rendering** logic in `ui/app.rs`. Possibilities:
1. `render_input()` being called multiple times without clearing previous renders
2. Event batching causing duplicate renders
3. Terminal cursor positioning issue (not clearing line before re-rendering)

**Location to investigate:**
- `synthia/src/ui/app.rs` - `render_input()` method
- Check if `clear_input_line()` is being called before each render
- Event loop in `run()` method - ensure we're not rendering on every character

**Severity:** High (UX issue - makes typing confusing and terminal output messy)

**Possible fix:**
The `render_input()` method should:
1. Call `clear_input_line()` first
2. Print the prompt once
3. Flush stdout

Check if we're accidentally rendering on:
- Every key event (should batch)
- Every UI update (should debounce)

## üîç Word Wrapping Validation

### Test Case: "Flask TODO app with HTML templates"

**Observation:**
Looking at the screenshots, I don't see any obvious mid-word breaks in the assistant's response. The original bug ("usin g HTML" breaking mid-word) appears to be **FIXED**.

**Evidence:**
- Tool outputs show "HTML templates" intact
- "Serving Flask app" intact
- No visible mid-word breaks in the long prompts

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Task 1 appears successful**

---

## Next Steps

### Priority Order for Fixes

1. **HIGH: Input line duplication (Issue #2)**
   - Investigate `render_input()` in `ui/app.rs`
   - Check terminal clearing logic
   - May be related to event batching changes

2. **MEDIUM: Tool output alignment (Issue #1)**
   - Investigate `UIUpdate::ToolResult` formatting
   - Simplify indentation logic
   - Ensure consistent left margin

### Not Blocking P2 Work

These are UI polish issues that don't affect core functionality:
- Tools execute correctly
- Word wrapping works
- No crashes or data loss

**Recommendation:** Document these for a future UI polish task (maybe P3 or P4), but proceed with P2 architecture improvements (parallel tools, memory management, caching).

---

## Test Environment

- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 23.6.0)
- **Terminal:** Unknown (likely iTerm2 or Terminal.app)
- **Terminal width:** Unknown (estimate ~120 columns based on screenshot)
- **Model:** Unknown (likely Claude 3.5 Sonnet based on clean tool calls)

---

## Screenshots

- `Image #1`: Tool output alignment issue (offset indentation)
- `Image #2`: Input line duplication issue (20+ repeated lines)

---

## Questions for User

1. **Input duplication frequency:** Does this happen every time you type, or only sometimes?
2. **Terminal emulator:** Are you using iTerm2, Terminal.app, or something else?
3. **Reproducibility:** Can you reproduce the input duplication by typing a new prompt?
4. **Terminal size:** What's your terminal width? (Run `tput cols` to check)

## Conclusion

**P1 Tasks Status:**
- ‚úÖ Task 1 (Word Wrapping): **SUCCESSFUL** - No mid-word breaks observed
- ‚úÖ Task 2 (JSON Parsing): **SUCCESSFUL** - Tools execute correctly
- ‚úÖ Task 3 (Event Batching): **SUCCESSFUL** - No hangs or crashes

**New Issues:**
- ‚ùå Issue #1: Tool output alignment (minor, cosmetic)
- ‚ùå Issue #2: Input line duplication (high priority, UX problem)

**Recommendation:**
- Create Issue #3 and #4 for tracking
- Proceed with P2 tasks
- Schedule UI polish fixes for later sprint
