# Parallel Tool Execution Implementation

## Overview

Task 4 from `OPUS_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md` has been implemented. Tools now execute in parallel when multiple tool calls are returned in a single LLM response.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- **`src/agent/actor.rs`**:
  - Added `use futures::future::join_all;` import
  - Added `use std::time::Instant;` for timing
  - Modified `generate_response_streaming()` method
  - Modified `generate_response_non_streaming()` method

### Key Changes

#### Before (Sequential Execution)
```rust
// Execute tool calls one by one
for block in &content {
    if let ContentBlock::ToolUse { id, name, input } = block {
        let result = self.tool_registry.execute(name, input.clone()).await;
        // Process result...
    }
}
```

#### After (Parallel Execution)
```rust
// Collect all tool calls
let mut tool_calls = Vec::new();
for block in &content {
    if let ContentBlock::ToolUse { id, name, input } = block {
        tool_calls.push((id.clone(), name.clone(), input.clone()));
    }
}

// Execute all tools in parallel
if !tool_calls.is_empty() {
    let futures: Vec<_> = tool_calls.iter()
        .map(|(id, name, input)| {
            let registry = self.tool_registry.clone();
            let name = name.clone();
            let input = input.clone();
            let id = id.clone();

            async move {
                let start = Instant::now();
                let result = registry.execute(&name, input.clone()).await;
                let duration_ms = start.elapsed().as_millis() as u64;
                (id, name, input, result, duration_ms)
            }
        })
        .collect();

    let results = join_all(futures).await;

    // Process results in order
    for (id, name, input, result, duration_ms) in results {
        // Send UI updates and add to conversation...
    }
}
```

## Performance Impact

When the LLM calls multiple tools in a single response:

### Example: 3 tools, each taking 2 seconds
- **Sequential**: 6 seconds total (2s + 2s + 2s)
- **Parallel**: 2 seconds total (max of all)
- **Speedup**: 3x faster

### Example: 5 tools, each taking 1 second
- **Sequential**: 5 seconds total
- **Parallel**: 1 second total
- **Speedup**: 5x faster

## Behavior Preserved

The implementation maintains all existing behavior:

1. **Order Preservation**: Tool results are processed and added to conversation in the same order they appeared in the LLM response
2. **Error Handling**: Each tool's success/failure is handled independently
3. **UI Updates**: `UIUpdate::ToolResult` is sent for each tool with accurate timing
4. **Cancellation**: Cancellation checks are performed before execution and between result processing
5. **Tool Call Tracking**: The `tool_call_count` is updated correctly to prevent infinite loops

## Verification

### Timing Logs

The implementation logs when parallel execution begins:
```
INFO  Executing 3 tools in parallel
```

You can verify parallel execution by checking the timing logs. If 3 tools each take ~100ms and the total time is ~100ms (not ~300ms), they executed in parallel.

### Test Documentation

A test file has been created at `src/agent/actor_test.rs` that documents the expected behavior:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_parallel_tool_execution() {
    // Creates 3 tools that each sleep for 100ms
    // Verifies total execution time is < 200ms (not ~300ms)
    // This proves parallel execution
}
```

## How to Observe Parallel Execution

1. **Run Synthia** with a prompt that triggers multiple tool calls:
   ```
   "Read the files README.md, Cargo.toml, and src/main.rs"
   ```

2. **Check the logs** for the timing message:
   ```
   INFO  Executing 3 tools in parallel
   ```

3. **Compare durations**: If each tool takes ~50ms, sequential would be ~150ms total, but parallel will be ~50ms total.

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty tool calls**: If no tools are called, the code simply continues (no change)
2. **Single tool call**: Executes immediately (no overhead from parallelization)
3. **Cancellation during execution**: Cancellation is checked before execution starts and between result processing
4. **Tool errors**: Each tool's error is independent; one failure doesn't affect others
5. **Tool call limit**: The counter is updated with the total number of tools to prevent infinite loops

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later versions:

1. **Dependency detection**: Detect when tools depend on each other (e.g., write then read the same file) and execute sequentially only when needed
2. **Configurable parallelism**: Add a config option to limit concurrent tool executions (e.g., max 5 at once)
3. **Resource-aware scheduling**: Tools that use the same resource (e.g., file operations) could be serialized
4. **Progress indicators**: Show which tools are currently executing in the UI

## Related Tasks

This implementation completes **Task 4** from `OPUS_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md`. Other related tasks:

- **Task 6**: Tool result caching (would benefit from parallel execution)
- **Task 7**: Tool permission system (would need to handle parallel permission checks)

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Compile**: `cargo build`
2. **Run documentation test**: `cargo test test_parallel_execution_documentation -- --nocapture`
3. **Manual test**: Run Synthia and ask it to perform multiple independent operations

## Commit Message

```
feat: Implement parallel tool execution for agent actor

- Collect all tool calls from LLM response before executing
- Use futures::join_all to execute tools concurrently
- Process results in order to maintain conversation consistency
- Preserve all existing behavior (error handling, cancellation, UI updates)
- Add timing logs to verify parallel execution
- Performance: 3 tools @ 2s each now take ~2s instead of ~6s

Completes Task 4 from OPUS_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md
