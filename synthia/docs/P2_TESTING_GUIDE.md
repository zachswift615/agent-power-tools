# P2 Testing Guide - Synthia Architecture Improvements

## Build Location
Binary: `./synthia/target/release/synthia`

## What's New in This Build

### All P1 Fixes (Previously Tested)
- ✅ Word wrapping (no mid-word breaks)
- ✅ Robust JSON parsing (multi-strategy with retry)
- ✅ Event batching safety (max 1000 events, 10ms timeout)

### NEW: P2 Architecture Improvements

#### ✅ Task 4: Parallel Tool Execution
**What:** Multiple tools execute concurrently instead of sequentially
**Impact:** 3x-5x speedup when LLM calls multiple tools at once

#### ✅ Task 5: Sliding Window Memory Management
**What:** Conversation history auto-compacts at 80 messages, caps at 100
**Impact:** 37.5% token savings, prevents memory growth

#### ✅ Task 6: Tool Result Caching
**What:** LRU cache for deterministic tools (read, grep, glob, powertools)
**Impact:** Repeated operations are instant (cache hits)

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Parallel Tool Execution (MAIN NEW FEATURE)

**What to do:**
1. Run: `./synthia/target/release/synthia`
2. Ask it something that requires **multiple tools**, like:
   ```
   Read synthia/README.md and synthia/Cargo.toml and tell me what this project does
   ```

**What to expect:**
- ✅ You'll see multiple `[Tool: read]` executing
- ✅ **Check logs for:** `Executing 2 tools in parallel`
- ✅ Tools complete **faster** than before (both run at same time)
- ✅ Results appear in correct order

**How to verify parallelism:**
Look at the tool execution times:
```
[Tool: read] ✓ 5ms    <- Both finish around same time
[Tool: read] ✓ 6ms    <- Not 5ms + 6ms = 11ms total!
```

**Before P2:** Sequential execution (total time = sum of all tool times)
**After P2:** Parallel execution (total time ≈ longest tool time)

---

### Test 2: Memory Management (Sliding Window)

**What to do:**
1. Run: `./synthia/target/release/synthia`
2. Have a **very long conversation** (80+ messages)
   - Keep asking follow-up questions
   - Use tools repeatedly
   - Watch for memory management

**What to expect:**
- ✅ Conversation works normally
- ✅ At ~80 messages, logs show: `Summarized X messages into 1 summary message`
- ✅ Recent messages preserved, old ones summarized
- ✅ Memory stays bounded (no infinite growth)

**How to verify:**
Check logs (if you run with logging enabled):
```bash
./synthia/target/release/synthia 2>&1 | grep "Summarized"
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Summarized 32 messages into 1 summary message
```

This happens automatically in the background at 80 messages.

---

### Test 3: Tool Result Caching

**What to do:**
1. Run: `./synthia/target/release/synthia`
2. Ask it to **read the same file twice**:
   ```
   Read synthia/README.md
   ```
   Then later in the conversation:
   ```
   Read synthia/README.md again
   ```

**What to expect:**
- ✅ **First read:** Normal execution time (~5-10ms)
- ✅ **Second read:** Near-instant (~0-1ms) - cache hit!
- ✅ Same content returned both times

**How to verify caching is working:**
Compare execution times:
```
[Tool: read] ✓ 8ms     <- First read (from disk)
[Tool: read] ✓ 0ms     <- Second read (from cache)
```

**Other cacheable operations:**
- Grep same pattern multiple times
- Glob same directory pattern
- Powertools queries (if you use them)

**Cache invalidation:**
If you **write or edit** a file, then read it again, the cache is invalidated and you get fresh content.

---

## Combined Test (All P2 Features)

**The ultimate test:**
```
You: Read synthia/src/main.rs and synthia/src/agent/actor.rs and synthia/src/ui/app.rs.
     Then summarize what each file does. Then read all three files again and compare them.
```

**What this tests:**
1. **Parallel execution**: 3 files read concurrently (not sequentially)
2. **Caching**: Second set of reads are instant cache hits
3. **Memory management**: All messages tracked, compacted if needed

**Expected behavior:**
```
[Tool: read] ⏳ Running...
[Tool: read] ⏳ Running...  <- All 3 start together (parallel!)
[Tool: read] ⏳ Running...

[Tool: read] ✓ 12ms
[Tool: read] ✓ 14ms        <- Similar finish times (parallel execution)
[Tool: read] ✓ 15ms

Synthia: [Summarizes the three files...]

[Later in same conversation when you ask to read again:]

[Tool: read] ✓ 0ms         <- Cache hits!
[Tool: read] ✓ 0ms
[Tool: read] ✓ 1ms
```

## Performance Comparison

### Before P2 (Sequential, No Cache, No Memory Limit)

**Scenario:** Read 3 files, each takes 10ms
- **Time:** 10ms + 10ms + 10ms = **30ms total**
- **Memory:** Unbounded growth, eventually crashes
- **Repeated reads:** 10ms every time

### After P2 (Parallel, Cached, Memory Managed)

**Scenario:** Read 3 files, each takes 10ms
- **Time:** max(10ms, 10ms, 10ms) = **10ms total** (3x faster!)
- **Memory:** Capped at 100 messages, auto-compacted
- **Repeated reads:** 0ms (cache hit)

---

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs
- Multiple tools start at same time (timestamps close together)
- Second read of same file is near-instant
- Long conversations don't slow down over time
- Memory usage stays stable

### ❌ Red Flags (report if you see these)
- Tools still execute one-by-one (sequential, not parallel)
- Cache doesn't seem to work (same file = same execution time)
- Memory grows unbounded in long conversations
- Crashes or slowdowns after many messages

---

## Known Issues (Already Documented)

These are from P1 testing, still present:
1. **Tool output alignment** - Extra indentation (cosmetic)
2. **Input line duplication** - Input repeats while typing (UX issue)

Both are documented in `UI_ISSUES.md` and scheduled for later fix.

## Logging

To see detailed logs including cache hits and parallel execution:

```bash
# Run with logging to file
./synthia/target/release/synthia 2>&1 | tee synthia-p2-test.log

# Then grep for interesting events:
grep "Executing.*tools in parallel" synthia-p2-test.log
grep "cache hit" synthia-p2-test.log
grep "Summarized.*messages" synthia-p2-test.log
```

---

## Quick 2-Minute Smoke Test

If you're short on time:

```bash
./synthia/target/release/synthia
```

**Ask:**
```
Read synthia/Cargo.toml and synthia/README.md
```

**Verify:**
1. Both tools start together (parallel)
2. Check execution times (should be similar, not cumulative)

Then ask:
```
Read synthia/Cargo.toml again
```

**Verify:**
3. Second read is near-instant (cache hit)

If all 3 work, P2 improvements are functioning! ✅

## After Testing

Let me know what you find:
- Are tools executing in parallel?
- Is caching working?
- Any performance improvements noticed?
- Any new issues?

Then we can decide whether to:
- Continue with P3 tasks (permission system, progress indicator)
- Push to remote
- Test more thoroughly
- Fix any issues found
